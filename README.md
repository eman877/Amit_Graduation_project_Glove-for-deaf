Deaf use the sign language to be in touch with surrounding people, unfortunately, the people must learn or know the sign language to connect with them.
â€¢ So, we will implement a device that can transcript the sign word on LCD:



Five flexible sensors must be put on all fingers respectively.
Flexible sensors fast response detect any motion of fingers.
According to the posture of fingers, the relative meaning will be printing on the LCD.
The number of words must be transcript must not be less than fifteen words.
Old word will be cleared if a new word is activated.
